		We are an Agile Team of 5 interns creating a tool to help Watson
		Oncology patients choose the best treatment for <i>them</i>. We aim to
		create the most compelling tool possible to help patients understand
		the side effects of various cancer treatments and make an educated
		decision on which one is best for them.
	</p>
	<p>We take the best treatment options identified by Watson and
		visualize the side effects, and allowing the patient to interact with
		the tool by specifying their tolerance of each side effect.</p>

			<h3>Be interactive.</h3>
			<p>Our visualization should help build trust between patients and
				Watson, through meaningful interaction design during patients
				decision process.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 text-center">
			<h3>Be ready to "listen".</h3>
			<p>We want our users to feel their opinions are heard and valued
				by Watson. Our visualization supports patients and physicians to
				collaborate on choosing their preferred treatments and most
				concerned adverse effects to compare; Our visualization also listen
				to users' tolerance level on each adverse effect.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 text-center">
			<h3>Be understanding.</h3>
			<p>We understand the stress faced by patients and physicans
				during treatment selection process. Thus, our visualization aims at
				minimizing users' efforts and efficient presentation.</p>
